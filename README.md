# square-run

inspired by geometry run (simplified version)

steps to complete:
- player (jumping)
- obstacles (high/low)
- game logic (collisions + score)
- game states

post project analysis:
positives:
- utilized classes well
- games main while loop is extremely neat and tidy
- banged out the entire game in one sitting (2ish hrs)
- had fun
- getting very comfortable with all main programming principles
negatives:
- got a little lazy at end and reused code from obstacle-doge for game states
- code itself (outside of while loop) is a pretty unorganized... although use of classes was great
- still didnt add animations or visual appeal to the game

on to the next one tomorrow!
